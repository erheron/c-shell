# c-shell
This project is a simple shell emulator, written in C, during my univ. course in system programming. It is capable of:
* running majority of regular shell commands
* running "builtin"-commands a special, narrow set of the following commands: exit, lcd, lls, lkill
* running background jobs and displaying information about them
* input/output redirection and pipelining
* signal handling
